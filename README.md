# Tik[honov Tetrac]order
------------------------------------------------

Tikhonov spectrum fitting, replicating certain features of R. N. Clark's "Tetracorder" approach but with a Bayesian flavor

Contact: David R. Thompson, david.r.thompson@jpl.nasa.gov

This codebase instantiates the algorithm described in Thompson et al. (2020).  It is based on the general methodology of the Tetracorder codebase (Clark et al., 2003).  The bundled example spectra come from the Cuprite, NV. overflight described in the Thompson et al. manuscript.  Library reference spectra come from the USGS spectral library version 7 (Kokaly et al., 2017).  In order to run the example, simply enter the test directory and execute the run_examples.sh bash script.
